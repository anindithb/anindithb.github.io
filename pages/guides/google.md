## Overview

This Guidance demonstrates ingesting Google Analytics 4 data
into AWS and activating marketing channels with customized audience profiles for marketing analytics. It explores each stage of building this solution and covers data ingestion, transformation, data cataloging, and analysis to prepare it for consumption using AWS native services.

## Cost and licenses

No licenses are required to deploy this solution. There is no cost to
use this solution, but you will be billed for any AWS services or
resources that this solution deploys.

You'll need the no-cost Google BigQuery Connector for AWS Glue from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-sqnd4gn5fykx6?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa){:target="_blank"}
to connect AWS Glue jobs to BigQuery.

## Architecture Overview

This sample solution will help customers securely ingest and analyze
first-party and third-party data. Marketers can further use this
information to activate marketing channels with customized segments.

***Figure 1** -- Architecture overview of a sample solution*

1.  Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule starts and runs the AWS Step
    Functions workflow.

2.  Google Cloud Big Query access credentials are securely stored in
    AWS Secrets Manager and encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

3.  AWS Glue job will ingest data using the [AWS Marketplace Google BigQuery Connector for AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-sqnd4gn5fykx6){:target="_blank"}.
    The connector simplifies the process of connecting AWS Glue jobs to
    extract data from BigQuery. This AWS Glue job will encrypt,
    normalize, and hash the data.

4.  The output of the AWS Glue job will be written to the target Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
    S3) bucket:prefix location in parquet format. The output file will be
    partitioned by date and encrypted with AWS KMS.

5.  AWS Glue Crawler job is initiated to "refresh" the table
    definition and its associated meta-data in the AWS Glue Data
    Catalog.

6.  The Data Consumer queries the data output with Amazon Athena.

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities
are shared between you and AWS. This shared model can reduce your
operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the components
from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the
physical security of the facilities where the services operate. For more
information about security on AWS, refer to [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security){:target="_blank"}.

### Amazon S3

Infrastructure components in the Guidance where user data flows through are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption
(SSE). Multiple Amazon S3 buckets are created for this solution and they are encrypted using S3-SSE AES-256
to secure user data.

### AWS KMS

This AWS service is used to encrypt the data stored in Amazon Kendra and
Amazon OpenSearch Service. In addition, AWS KMS is used to encrypt the
data in transit through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

### Secrets Manager

Secrets Manager will encrypt secrets at rest using
encryption keys you own and store in AWS KMS.

## Implementation steps

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this section to configure the
solution into your account.

### Deploying the Project with AWS Cloud Development Kits

The project code uses the Python version of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/){:target="_blank"} (AWS CDK). To start the project
code, please ensure that you have fulfilled the [AWS CDK Prerequisites for Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html){:target="_blank"}.

The project code requires that the AWS account is [bootstrapped](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html){:target="_blank"}
in order to allow the deployment of the AWS CDK stack.

### AWS CDK Deployment

navigate to project directory:

```cd aws-glue-connector-ingestion-ga4-analytics```


install and activate a Python Virtual Environment:

```python3 -m venv .venv```

```source .venv/bin/activate```


install dependent libraries:

```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

### AWS CDK Context Parameters Configuration
