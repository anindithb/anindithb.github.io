This implementation guide provides an overview of the \"Guidance for
Meter Data Analytics on AWS,\" its reference architecture and
components, considerations for planning the deployment, and
configuration steps for deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This
guide is intended for solution architects, business decision makers,
DevOps engineers, data scientists, and cloud professionals who want to
implement \"Guidance for Meter Data Analytics on AWS\" in their
environment.

## Overview

This guide covers the information you need to deploy "Guidance for Meter
Data Analytics on AWS" in your AWS environment.

## Costs and licenses

This implementation guide is offered to users at no cost. However, if
you deploy "Guidance for Meter Data Analytics to AWS" in your
environment, you will be billed for any AWS services or resources you
use in the deployment.

## Architecture

Deploying this Guidance with default parameters builds the Meter Data
Analytics (MDA) environment in the AWS Cloud, as shown in Figure 1.

<!--[Architecture](media/image3.png){width="6.5in"height="3.6555555555555554in"}-->

{% include image.html file="meter_data_analytics_images/MD_Figure1.png" %}
*Figure 1. Solution architecture for Meter Data Analytics on AWS.*

This Guidance sets up the following services:

-   Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets to store:

    -   Weather and topology data from external databases.

    -   Raw meter data.

    -   Partitioned data.

    -   Processed data from the AWS Step Functions model training workflow.

-   AWS Lambda functions to:

    -   Load and transform topology data from an external database.

    -   Process late-arriving meter data.

    -   Obtain API query results of partitioned business data and Amazon SageMaker inferences.

-   An AWS Glue crawler to transform meter data from the meter data management (MDM) system and headend system (HES) system into partitioned data.

-   Amazon EventBridge to process and store late-arriving meter data in the correct partition.

-   AWS Glue Data Catalog for a central catalog of weather, topology, and meter data.

-   Amazon Athena to provide query results of partitioned data.

-   Two Step Functions workflows:

    -   Model training to build a machine learning (ML) model using partitioned business data.

    -   Batch processing of partitioned business data from the Data Catalog and ML model data for use in forecasting.

-   SageMaker to generate energy usage inferences using the ML model.

-   Amazon API Gateway to manage API queries.

## Deployment options

This Guidance provides one deployment option:

-	CloudFormation (CFN) template – This uses assets already deployed in public S3 buckets. To use the latest updates, you have to use the ‘Manual deployment’ process.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o	Download the template from https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-meter-data-analytics-on-aws/blob/main/templates/work-load.template.yaml

-	Manual deployment – Build and deploy in your AWS account

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  o	Steps to build and deploy are in https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-meter-data-analytics-on-aws


This Guidance lets you configure instance types and MDA settings.

### Predeployment steps

### Meter data generator and HES simulator

The input adapter regularly pulls data from the HES simulator and
prepares the data for further processing. During deployment, you can
choose to deploy the meter data generator and HES simulator stacks by
choosing ENABLED for the MeterDataGenerator parameter. You also
configure the number of meters and the interval between meter reads with
the TotalDevices and GenerationInterval parameters, respectively. The
default values for these parameters generate 10,000 reads every 15
minutes.

## Deployment steps - using CFN

1.  Sign in to your AWS account, and download the CloudFormation template for this Guidance, as described under [Deployment options](#deployment-options).

2.  Navigate to **CloudFormations.**

3.  Select **Create stack**.

4.  Select **Upload a template file**.

5.  Select **Choose file** and select the downloaded file.

6.  On the **Create stack** page, choose **Next**.

7.  On the **Specify stack details** page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose **Next**.

{: .note }
>Unless you're customizing the Guidance templates or are instructed otherwise in this guide's **Predeployment** section, don't change the default settings for the following parameters: ```QSS3BucketName```, ```QSS3BucketRegion```, and ```QSS3KeyPrefix```. Changing the values of these parameters will modify code references that point to the Amazon S3 bucket name and key prefix.

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
8.  On the **Configure stack options** page, you can [specify tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html){:target="_blank"} (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and [set advanced options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html){:target="_blank"}. When you finish, choose **Next**.

9.  On the **Review** page, review and confirm the template settings. Under **Capabilities**, select all of the check boxes to acknowledge that the template creates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources that might require the ability to automatically expand macros.

10. Choose **Create stack**. The stack takes about 30 minutes to deploy.

11. Monitor the stack's status, and when the status is **CREATE_COMPLETE**, the MDA deployment is ready.

12. To view the created resources, choose the **Outputs** tab.

### Postdeployment steps

**Set up Amazon Managed Grafana dashboards**

This Guidance includes a set of Amazon Managed Grafana dashboards. These
dashboards use Athena to query data stored in a data lake and depend on
several of the optional datasets for full functionality.

{: .note }
>Amazon Managed Grafana supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and IAM Identity Center for authentication. If your organization does not have SAML or IAM Identity Center set up, consult your administrator.

### Create a Grafana workspace

1.  Select the **Dashboards** icon, and then select **Browse**.

2.  You should see all the imported dashboards. Select each dashboard to
    view.

After importing, you may need to verify that the names of dashboard
panel data sources match AWS Glue database names. If you receive errors,
check panel data sources and variables in dashboard settings. For more
information, refer to [Adding or editing a panel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/add-a-panel-to-a-dashboard.html){:target="_blank"} and [Dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/dashboard-overview.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Input adapter

As shown in Figure 5, the Guidance's input adapter loads meter reads
from an external source (such as HES or FTP) and prepares them for
processing.

<!--[Inputadapter](media/image7.png){width="6.5in" height="3.348611111111111in"}-->

{% include image.html file="meter_data_analytics_images/MD_Figure5.png" %}

*Figure 5. Input adapter*

A Step Functions workflow orchestrates the generation and download of
the meter-reads file as a compressed file from the external database to
the inbound bucket. Another process extracts the file from the inbound
bucket and stores it in the uncompressed folder. The inbound bucket
stores the compressed and uncompressed files. The Guidance deletes
uncompressed files to save on storage and costs.

After the file is extracted, the Guidance generates an event that
invokes a Lambda function for further processing. The
file-range-extractor Lambda function extracts range information from the
uncompressed file based on the file size and number of chunks
(configurable). A range is a group of lines that you want to process
together. Extracted range information is sent to Amazon Simple Queue
Service (Amazon SQS).

Each worker takes a range from the Amazon SQS queue and processes the
respective meter reads (parse and transform) before sending each element
to Amazon Kinesis. This process ensures that the content input file can
be processed in parallel. The worker transforms the CSV line into JSON
and creates a separate object for each reading type. The Amazon Kinesis
data stream ingests the data into the staging area. This stream scales
on demand.

### Dataflows

You can set up connections to other data sources by configuring
additional dataflows. As shown in Figure 6, a dataflow connects to the
external database, loads data from it, and stores data in a
purpose-built database that can be accessed from the Guidance's central
data catalog.

<!--[](media/image8.png){width="6.4792596237970255in" height="2.534884076990376in"}-->

{% include image.html file="meter_data_analytics_images/MD_Figure6.png" %}
*Figure 6. Dataflow*

The Guidance comes with two sample dataflows: weather and topology. To
add a new dataflow, create a data pipeline that loads data from the
source, prepares the data, and stores results in an appropriate data
store. Then, add the data store you've configured to the Guidance's data
catalog.

### Data partitioning

The weather data is partitioned in the S3 bucket ```s3://gen-disabled-aws-utility-met-integrateddatabucket-\*/weather/date=\<year\>-\<month\>-\<day\>/\<data-file-in-parquet-format\>```

The topology data is stored in the S3 bucket ```s3://gen-disabled-aws-utility-met-integrateddatabucket-\*/topology/```

The curated data in the integration stage S3 bucket is partitioned by reading type, year, month, day, and hour, as follows:
```shell
s3://\*-integrateddatabucket-\*/readings/parquet/reading_type=\<reading_type_value\>/year=\<year\>/month=\<month\>/day=\<day\>/hour=\<hour\>/\<meter-data-file-in-parquet-format\>
```

You can find all meter reads for the hour of a day on the lowest level
of the partition tree. To optimize query performance, the data is stored
in a column-based file format (Parquet).

### Late-arriving data

The data lake handles late-arriving meter reads. Late-arriving meter
reads are detected as soon as the data reaches the staging phase. If a
late read is detected, an event is sent to Amazon EventBridge. The
extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline moves the late read to the
correct partition and ensures that data is stored in an optimized way.
